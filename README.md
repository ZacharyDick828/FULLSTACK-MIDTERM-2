# Asheville Electronic Music Databse

This project was created with the idea to store contact information for artists of all types. This would allow Event Organizers to contact artists in the area or abroad to schedule events. 

## Functionality 

Users are greeted by the Home screen and then given options to learn more about the database in the **`About`** section, or head to the database in the **`Artists`** section.

## Artists Database

The database lists artists in the Asheville area and provides contact information in order to make them more accessible for booking. 

New artists are able to be added by clicking `Add Artist`.

Artist information can updated or corrected by clicking the `Edit` button, located to the left of the Artist's information.

Artist information can also be deleted from the database by clicking `Delete`, located beside the `Edit` button.

Please enjoy the database and use responsibly! [Placeholder DatabaseName: redirects to this page](https://github.com/ZacharyDick828/FULLSTACK-MIDTERM-2)
